Results of encoder backbone experiment

Mobile net performed the best by a little bit and is by far the smallest model in terms of parameters. Considering limited computational resources, mobile net seems like the best choice as an encoder. See /hyperparameter_logs for results of hyperparameter tuning UNet++ with a mobile net backbone.
